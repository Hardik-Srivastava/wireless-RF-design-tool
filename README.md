# Wireless Network Design Tool

This Python project provides a simple tool for designing wireless networks, including site survey analysis, coverage planning, and visualization. It offers functionalities to perform various tasks related to RF (Radio Frequency) design, such as antenna selection, transmit power control, interference mitigation, security measures, quality of service (QoS), and network management.

## Features

- **Site Survey**: Analyze the physical environment and layout of the campus or building where the wireless network will be deployed.
- **Coverage Planning**: Determine the areas that require wireless coverage and optimize signal strength for reliable connectivity.
- **Frequency Spectrum Analysis**: Analyze the RF spectrum to identify interference sources and select optimal frequency bands.
- **Access Point Placement**: Strategically place access points (APs) to ensure uniform coverage and adequate signal strength.
- **Antenna Selection**: Choose the appropriate antenna types based on coverage requirements and environmental factors.
- **Transmit Power Control**: Adjust the transmit power levels of APs to optimize coverage and minimize interference.
- **Interference Mitigation**: Implement strategies to mitigate interference from external sources.
- **Security Measures**: Configure encryption protocols and authentication methods to secure wireless communications.
- **Quality of Service (QoS)**: Configure QoS settings to prioritize network traffic based on application requirements.
- **Network Management**: Deploy a centralized management system for monitoring, configuration, and troubleshooting of the RF network.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Hardik-Srivastava/wireless-RF-design-tool.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
    cd wireless-network-design-tool
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Modify the Python scripts (`site_survey.py`, `coverage_planning.py`, etc.) to customize the network design parameters and configurations according to your requirements.

2. Run the Python scripts to perform specific tasks, such as site survey analysis, coverage planning, or visualization.

    ```
    python main.py
    ```

3. View the generated outputs, such as site survey plots or coverage area visualizations, to analyze the results and make informed decisions about your wireless network design.
